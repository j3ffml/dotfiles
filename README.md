dotfiles
========

Infrequently updated collection of my own dotfiles and configs.

Installation
------------
```
$ bash install
```
Then in vim,
```
:PluginInstall
```
To install vim plugins with Vundle. It's likely you will need to install one of
the fonts in util/fonts to display prompt and vim-powerline correctly.
