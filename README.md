dotfiles
========

My dotfiles and some settings with a bash install script. Mostly oh-my-zsh with some customizations.
Install script is often broken, continually being updated.


Installation
============

```
$ bash install
```

Then in vim,
```
:BundleInstall
```
To install vim plugins with Vundle. It's likely you will need to install one of
the fonts in util/fonts to display prompt and vim-powerline correctly
